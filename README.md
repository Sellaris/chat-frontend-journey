## Technology Stack
This project is built with .
- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

## Implement functions

- Front end speech to text input based on React
- An easy-to-use API management system (currently only supports Moonshot AI)
- Prompt with four different types of built-in assistants
- The return content of expandable backend LLM as a thinking process

## Backend adaptation

Replace the path of ChatInterface. tsx: 226 with your own backend database query URL (stream return).

FrontendDemo.exe is an example of backend adaptation for this project. The backend for this original code has already processed cross domain requests, so there is no need to configure CORS separately for this frontend.

**But you need to adaptation your own backend (DataBase, vector query, LLM) for this frontend projct.**
